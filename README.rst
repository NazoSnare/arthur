Whence the name?
================

The server side to this is called merlin_, because the step-by-step
oracle-like model reminded me of Merlin in the AM complexity class and
`Arthur-Merlin protocols`_. Since Arthur is the person who performs
the protocol together with Merlin, it only made sense to name this
project `arthur`.
